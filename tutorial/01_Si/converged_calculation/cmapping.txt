# Mapping of Wannier functions (valence or conduction)
#
# This file contains the mapping Wannier functions given by their
# quantum number (id) to the path of the associated XSF file (XCrysDen Structure
# File) that is obtained from wannier90.
# The id also specifies the c1,c2,v1 and v2 variables in the plan and output file.

# Format: id --> path/to/xsf-file
