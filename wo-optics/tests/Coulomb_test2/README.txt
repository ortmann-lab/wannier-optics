We test the correct implementation of Coulomb matrix elements for a 2x2x2 supercell.
A matrix is preparated by the entries in COULOMB file and onsite energies. The same
matrix is defined within the python script 'peak_analysis.py'. Finally, the eigenvalues
are compared and should give the same results.
