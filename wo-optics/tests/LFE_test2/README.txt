In this test we setup a matrix where we specify the single entries by local field effects.
The LFE are only specified in different unit cells.
Also single particle TIs and onsite energies are used.

The matrix can be solved with numpy (see peak_analysis script) and with the exciton code.

Changes in the supercell (POSCAR) should give warnings that not all excitonic TIs are used.
